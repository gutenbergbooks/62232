<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>A
LETTER, &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="GutSmall">REV. SIR,</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of those good-natured friends
with which the world abounds, took an early opportunity of
conveying to my hands a copy of your Address to Lord Teignmouth
as President of the British and Foreign Bible Society; and I can
really assume you, that its effect upon my nerves was almost as
great as that which his Lordship&rsquo;s circular letter produced
upon yours.&nbsp; &ldquo;The emotions of my mind,&rdquo; too,
&ldquo;upon the receipt of it, were such as I am not inclined,
for several reasons, to describe.&rdquo; <a
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a></p>
<p>You must know, Sir, that it had been my fortune to fall into
the same ugly snare as the worthy Nobleman whose eyes you have so
graciously endeavoured to open.&nbsp; I too had been drawn into
the horrid Bible-plot, without dreaming that there was any plot
in the business; and, to tell you the honest truth, before your
pamphlet reached me, <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>I had actually lent all the name I possessed, and all the
money I could spare, in order to assist in carrying its designs
into execution.</p>
<p>Judge then, Sir, what must have been my feelings upon learning
from you, that our Noble President, instead of being, as I
thought, most loyally, usefully, and religiously employed, had
&ldquo;bestowed his patronage and protection upon every
description of the church&rsquo;s enemies;&rdquo; that he had
deserted &ldquo;the cause of sound religion;&rdquo; and that he
was actually &ldquo;confederating with persons openly labouring
the destruction of all that is sober and established.&rdquo; <a
name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a></p>
<p>The inference was too much against me to leave me at
rest.&nbsp; I called to my recollection, how prone the world is
to say, &ldquo;like master, like man;&rdquo; and in the first
paroxysms of my fear, had half a mind to send a line to the
Secretary, and request that my name might be withdrawn.&nbsp;
This seemed, however, too strong a measure to be adopted in so
early a stage of the business; besides, though I could not wholly
suppress my alarms, yet I had some little scruple about
proclaiming them publicly to the world.&nbsp; In these moments of
irresolution, it occurred to my mind, that you might perhaps,
without any malicious design, have overstated the mischief; that
the evils which you predicted as likely to follow from this
unhallowed <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>project, might in reality have nothing to do with it; and
that, at all events, your frightful statement exhibited only
<i>one side</i> of the case.&nbsp; Perhaps, thought I, some
&ldquo;liberal-basis&rsquo;d&rdquo; <a name="citation3a"></a><a
href="#footnote3a" class="citation">[3a]</a> gentleman will
overthrow this high-church reasoning, and try to bring this
bilious Country Priest to a better temper: I may then be inclined
to wish, that I had paid less homage to that ex-parte evidence by
which he sought to discredit a noble cause.</p>
<p>Unluckily for me, the printers had scarcely struck off the
large impression of your Address, when they came to a resolution
to print nothing further. <a name="citation3b"></a><a
href="#footnote3b" class="citation">[3b]</a>&nbsp; Now though I
did not suspect any confederacy in the business, yet I could not
help thinking that <i>you</i> were much obliged to them.&nbsp;
However that may be, it was evidently in vain to wait for
Replies: if fifty had been written (and I suppose that at least
as many were expected), not one could find its way before the
public.&nbsp; At length I hit upon a project; and what do you
think it was?&nbsp; But <i>you</i> would be the last to
guess.&nbsp; It was that of <i>reading your pamphlet over
again</i>.&nbsp; I had observed that the birds in my garden who
were scared away by the first sight of my man-of-straw, would,
after a second view, pursue their instinctive robberies with as
much composure as if they had really discovered how little
mischief he <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>could do them.&nbsp; I was pleased with the thought, and
anticipated much the same consequences.&nbsp; Well, Sir, I made
the experiment; and the event, I assure you, exceeded my highest
expectation.&nbsp; I rose from the <i>second</i> reading of your
Address with feelings so different from those of conviction or
alarm, that if I did not think it would ruffle a temper so
irritable as yours, I could almost find it in my heart to tell
you what they were.&nbsp; However, as I shall have occasion to
speak my mind pretty freely in the course of this Letter, you
will have no difficulty in discovering what I ultimately thought
both of you and your performance.</p>
<p>But now, Sir, to business.&nbsp; You open your Address to Lord
Teignmouth with a preamble, which sets forth, that you are
&ldquo;not inclined, for several reasons, to describe the
emotions of your mind upon the receipt of his Lordship&rsquo;s
Address, as President of the British and Foreign Bible
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is an air of mystery in these words,
which recommended them strongly to my notice; and if you do me
the favour to turn back to my first page, you will find that I
have employed them as you have done, <i>in fronte
operis</i>.&nbsp; I am, however, upon reflection, inclined to
think that &ldquo;there is,&rdquo; to use your own words upon
another occasion, &ldquo;more of sound than sense&rdquo; in this
affectation of reserve on both sides.&nbsp; For, to say the
truth, I have already revealed <i>my</i> emotions, and I am sure
you have taken no pains to conceal <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span><i>yours</i>: and yet it must be
manifest that if each of us had not been <i>inclined</i> to do
it, neither of us would have done it.&nbsp; However, the preamble
has its use; for it invites the reader to believe, that we are
both of us men of peace and charity, and very unwilling to injure
the feelings and reputation of our neighbour: an assumption
which, in your case, it was the more necessary to make; as
otherwise the reader of your pages might, innocently enough, have
concluded the reverse.</p>
<p>This brief exordium dispatched, you enter, pell-mell, upon the
matter of your indictment, and prefer your charges against the
Noble Lord with as little ceremony, as if you had borrowed the
robes of his Majesty&rsquo;s Attorney General, and were
prosecuting the Noble delinquent at the suit of the Crown.&nbsp;
But let us hear the accusation opened.&nbsp; His Lordship (you
say), by taking the presidency of the Bible Society, has
&ldquo;bestowed his patronage and protection upon every
description of the church&rsquo;s enemies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now here
I doubt the accuracy of your representation: I am strongly
inclined to think that you do not mean to affirm quite so much as
you say.&nbsp; The church&rsquo;s enemies are so numerous, and
some of them so little known, that I think it very probable many
descriptions could be mentioned, which have never obtained a
place in your enumeration.&nbsp; I have <i>your</i> authority for
setting down all the individuals who dissent from the
church&rsquo;s communion as her decided enemies, <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>for they wish
to a man to blow up the national establishment, &ldquo;clergy and
all:&rdquo; you know they do&mdash;&ldquo;<i>one</i> of them
said&rdquo; so.&nbsp; Such evidence as this, to be sure, must not
for a moment be questioned; though I should have thought better
of it, if your informer had shown his instructions for saying so
much in the name of the rest.&nbsp; But if I concede to you that
<i>these</i> are the church&rsquo;s enemies, I cannot admit, what
I suspect you wish to imply, that these are the <i>only</i>
enemies with which she has to contend.&nbsp; What think you of
&ldquo;those men of influence and consideration, who continue to
revile the church, and still think proper to remain nominal
members of her community?&rdquo; <a name="citation6a"></a><a
href="#footnote6a" class="citation">[6a]</a>&nbsp; Into what
class do you throw those &ldquo;men of the world, who, in their
sober moments, think it more creditable to be accounted members
of our venerable church, than a subscriber to the
meeting-house?&rdquo; <a name="citation6b"></a><a
href="#footnote6b" class="citation">[6b]</a>&nbsp; And lastly,
where do you place those partisans, whether priests or laymen,
who, while they contend for the church as the &ldquo;chaste
spouse of Christ,&rdquo; <a name="citation6c"></a><a
href="#footnote6c" class="citation">[6c]</a> confound most
unwittingly both her pretensions and her character, with those by
which that spiritual harlot is known, who has committed
fornication with the kings of the earth? <a
name="citation6d"></a><a href="#footnote6d"
class="citation">[6d]</a>&nbsp; For my part, I recognise among
such <i>false friends</i> as the two first descriptions, and such
<i>injudicious </i><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span><i>advocates</i> as the last, some of those enemies, from
which the church has most to fear.&nbsp; But I think I do you no
injustice when I say, that it does not seem to have been your
intention to include such characters as these within those
&ldquo;descriptions of the church&rsquo;s enemies,&rdquo; upon
which his Lordship is blameable for having bestowed his patronage
and protection.</p>
<p>But, waiving these considerations, let me ask the Country
Clergyman, wherein he designs to make the Noble President&rsquo;s
guilt consist.&nbsp; It cannot be in the <i>bare and simple
act</i> of bestowing his patronage and protection upon every
description of &ldquo;the church&rsquo;s enemies.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For such an <i>act</i> his Lordship has the highest precedent,
and the least questionable authority.&nbsp; For every time the
several denominations of Christians meet to worship God according
to their various rites (and they may meet just as often as they
will), they enjoy the patronage and protection of that exalted
Personage, who, as the guardian of the constitution, is present
wherever there are rights to protect, and laws to protect
them.&nbsp; Upon this point, therefore, no controversy can arise:
and the main question between us will be, whether the
<i>object</i> for which this patronage and protection are
bestowed be of a nature to favour the assumed hostilities of the
different denominations of Christians against the established
church.&nbsp; Now that object, as defined by his Lordship, is,
&ldquo;to promote the circulation of the Scriptures at home and
abroad;&rdquo; and this <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>you admit &ldquo;is an object in which
every one, who professes the religion of Christ, must feel a deep
interest.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am glad to find you admitting as much as
this; and I hope I do not misunderstand you.&nbsp; Indeed I am so
desirous of tracing an agreement between us, wherever I can find
a ground for doing it, that I will endeavour to persuade myself,
though the delusion should prove never so short, that the
circulation of the Scriptures is not among the points on which we
differ.&nbsp; But you question whether <i>this</i> be the object;
since &ldquo;the object of a society is not to be known from its
public declaration in print;&rdquo; <a name="citation8"></a><a
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a> and yet, shrewd as
this remark appears, I cannot but think that &ldquo;the
declaration in print,&rdquo; of a large body of men, subscribed
with their names, is rather better authority for judging of their
specific object, than <i>the insinuation in print</i> of an
anonymous individual: and I believe that most of the world will
be of the same opinion.&nbsp; I know indeed that declarations in
print are not to be credited merely because they are <i>made</i>:
but yet I cannot think that the mere act of <i>making</i> them is
a reason why they should be discredited.&nbsp; For, if the rule
were established for interpreting every &ldquo;declaration in
print&rdquo; into its opposite, I should be justified at once in
concluding that <i>your object</i> is to become a member of this
obnoxious Association; <i>merely</i> because you <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>declare in
print, &ldquo;I cannot join myself to your Bible Society.&rdquo;
<a name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a></p>
<p>Surely, Sir, as a Country Clergyman, you must have heard of
the vaccine inoculation.&nbsp; Now there is an association in the
metropolis to which that ingenious invention has given birth, and
which is publicly known as the <i>Jennerian Society</i>.&nbsp; I
see no reason why it might not as properly be called &ldquo;the
British and Foreign Vaccine Society,&rdquo; since its object is
&ldquo;to promote the circulation of vaccine matter at home and
abroad.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now indulge yourself for a moment with the
supposition, that when this Society had printed their
&ldquo;object, their principles, and their reasons,&rdquo; and
solicited the countenance and support of the faculty and persons
of every denomination, some country physician had stepped from
his obscurity, and opened a smart attack upon them.&nbsp; Suppose
him to have contended with all the gravity in the world,
&ldquo;that the object of a Society is not to be known from its
public declaration in print;&rdquo; <a name="citation9b"></a><a
href="#footnote9b" class="citation">[9b]</a> that Societies which
afterwards found their way &ldquo;to the Old Bailey, or the
Maidstone assizes,&rdquo; had announced themselves to the world
by &ldquo;printed declarations of their reasons, objects, and
principles;&rdquo; <a name="citation9c"></a><a href="#footnote9c"
class="citation">[9c]</a> and that for his own part, though he
saw in their President a nobleman, &ldquo;for whose head and
heart he had the highest respect,&rdquo; and <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>among their
supporters &ldquo;many respectable names, with which he should be
happy to place his own;&rdquo; <a name="citation10a"></a><a
href="#footnote10a" class="citation">[10a]</a> yet because they
received guineas from quacks and empirics, as well as from
regulars and licentiates in medicine, he considered the whole
Society as a dangerous combination against the health of the
community, and a conspiracy for effecting the diabolical design
of poisoning his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects.&nbsp; What, Sir, would
you think of such a worthy gentleman?&nbsp; You would not
question his sincerity, for no man who was not &ldquo;horribly
afraid&rdquo; <a name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a> would intimate suspicions for which he
was likely to gain so little credit among mankind: but I think
you would feel yourself at liberty to question something about
him, which if it did not provoke your resentment, might
deservedly enough excite your compassion.</p>
<p>I am glad to find, as I advance farther into your pages, that
things are not quite so bad as I had apprehended.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Far be it from me to say,&rdquo; you tell his Lordship,
&ldquo;that you preside over an association of men combined for
designs altogether bad; that you patronize and protect a Society,
whose objects and principles are wilfully nefarious.&rdquo; <a
name="citation10c"></a><a href="#footnote10c"
class="citation">[10c]</a>&nbsp; Now though this apology for
insinuations which might as well have been withheld, is not
wholly purged from bile, yet I confess it gives me pleasure to
see it made at all; because it <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>delivers <i>me</i> from the logical
difficulty of proving a negative, and <i>you</i> from the logical
disgrace of requiring it.</p>
<p>At present then it seems, that the majority of this Society,
though weak and deceivable, are not Jacobinical or designing
men.&nbsp; It is not within their <i>present</i> intention to
&ldquo;pursue an object of an evil tendency in a close and
clandestine manner, under favour of a public declaration of
different, and&rdquo; even &ldquo;a contrary character.&rdquo; <a
name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a>&nbsp; Nay, so little are they
suspected of being <i>as yet</i> &ldquo;wilfully
nefarious,&rdquo; that if his Lordship can give you such a
security as you require, for the maintenance of its original
intentions, you think the Society &ldquo;will be what it
proposes,&rdquo; and you &ldquo;shall be proud to rank&rdquo;
your &ldquo;name, and make exertion under his protection.&rdquo;
<a name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a></p>
<p>I do assure you, Sir, that my jealousies on this particular
are quite as much alive as yours can be.&nbsp; I know how apt
Societies are to depart from the principles upon which their
original association was formed; and I am half inclined to think,
that in this and other parts of your pamphlet you are reading a
lesson to some Societies in the metropolis, that I could
name.&nbsp; However, I do not absolutely affirm that such is your
intention; for though I might take advantage of your own axiom,
and suspect your &ldquo;declaration in print&rdquo; to be
<i>one</i> <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>thing and your real object <i>another</i>, yet I should
think it scarcely decorous to say so.&nbsp; Besides, it is very
possible after all, that the whole may have been the result of
accident; and that you had no design whatever of publishing the
<i>actual</i> state of one Society, when you were merely
predicting the <i>future</i> state of another.</p>
<p>But, Sir, let me ask you now, in the best humour in the world,
what security you would require for the maintenance of an
original object which the Bible Society has not already given
you.&nbsp; I grant, if you had been invited to join a Society,
whose object was the promotion of Christianity, the reformation
of manners, or the suppression of vice, you might reasonably
enough have doubted whether the nature of the object sufficiently
explained the views of the associators, and gave you any
competent pledge for the purity of those measures which they
might in process of time adopt.&nbsp; You might then have argued
with some show of plausibility, that &ldquo;the <i>real
object</i> will take its colour from the opinions and pursuits of
those <i>effective members</i>, who shall contrive, either by an
actual majority, or an <i>assiduity and activity equivalent in
force to the power of a majority</i>, to give direction to the
energy of the association;&rdquo; <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a> and the event, in
certain cases, would have proved, that you were not very greatly
mistaken.&nbsp; But in the case under consideration, the object
is definite.&nbsp; <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>For the Bible (<i>which</i> and which <i>alone</i>
constitutes that object) is specific; and is further secured, by
its authorized translation into all the languages of the United
Kingdom, against the possibility of losing its specific
character.&nbsp; Now since the Society are bound, by a law of
their constitution, to circulate the <i>authorized</i> version of
the Scriptures, and that <i>alone</i>, their object must remain
so uniform and determinate, that no deviation from it can occur,
without a perceivable, an obvious, a felonious sacrifice of
justice, honor, and good faith.&nbsp; Of such departure
therefore, if ever it should be attempted, the public will most
infallibly be apprized.&nbsp; For those respectable characters
<i>at least</i>, with whom you would be proud to rank your name,
will be the witnesses, the opposers, and (if unsuccessful in
their opposition) the reporters of such apostacy; and I hardly
need remind you that the efficiency of their exertions under all
these characters, will be diminished in the same proportion, in
which you may contrive to reduce their numbers, and discredit
their association.</p>
<p>So much for that security which the object of the Society
affords.&nbsp; But let us hear what sort of security you, in the
exercise of your moderation, are disposed to require.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If Lord T. will pledge himself that the six hundred
members of his Society are, like himself, honourable and upright
men, who speak what they mean, and practise what they profess,
who abhor duplicity and deceit, <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and know no discordance between the
object they <i>profess</i> and the object they
<i>pursue</i>&mdash;if Lord T. can assure me this, I shall be
proud to rank my name, and make exertion under his
protection.&rdquo; <a name="citation14a"></a><a
href="#footnote14a" class="citation">[14a]</a></p>
<p>And are these really, Sir, the lowest terms upon which the
benefit of your name can be obtained for the British and Foreign
Bible Society?&nbsp; If they are, I must fairly own, humiliating
as the confession may appear, I have no hope of hearing that the
Secretary has been called upon &ldquo;to insert your name and
accept your donation.&rdquo; <a name="citation14b"></a><a
href="#footnote14b" class="citation">[14b]</a>&nbsp; No Sir; his
Lordship cannot go such lengths as you require.&nbsp; I dare say
he would do every thing in his power to satisfy you; but I think
I may venture to say, without consulting him, that this exceeds
his power.&nbsp; His Lordship is a student of human nature, and
the situations which he has filled, have afforded him
opportunities of pursuing his favorite study.&nbsp; How he has
employed those opportunities, and what fruit he has derived from
them, I need not tell you.&nbsp; I dare say you have not lost
your respect for the biographer of Sir William Jones, in your
resentment against the President of the Bible Society.&nbsp; But,
with all his powers of discrimination, his Lordship has his
limits as well as <i>other</i> men; and I hope you would not wish
him to vouch <i>for</i> or <i>against</i> a large class of
individuals, as you may have found some people inclined to <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>do, merely on
account of certain peculiar specimens which he has seen, or some
indistinct reports which he has heard.</p>
<p>But surely, Sir, I may be excused for doubting whether you
&ldquo;be in jest or earnest,&rdquo; <a name="citation15"></a><a
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a> when you meet his
Lordship&rsquo;s proposition with such exorbitant demands.&nbsp;
Did you ever know a President who could engage for quite so much
as you require?&nbsp; Or did you ever see &ldquo;six
hundred&rdquo; names together, that stood for nothing less than
so many &ldquo;honorable and upright men?&rdquo;&nbsp; I am sure
I venerate every useful Society throughout the kingdom, from the
Society for <i>promoting Christian Knowledge</i>, down to the
Society for <i>superseding the Necessity of Climbing Boys</i>;
and yet I should not be surprised if their respective Presidents
should decline bearing their testimony to the individual
characters of the first <i>six hundred</i> members of those
several Societies upon which I might choose to lay my hand.&nbsp;
Besides, Sir, consider&mdash;a rule for <i>one</i>, in such a
case is a rule for <i>all</i>.&nbsp; What you require
<i>before</i> you subscribe your name, others may think
themselves justified in requiring <i>after</i> you have
subscribed it.&nbsp; And what will be the consequence?&mdash;His
Lordship will next be called upon to pledge himself for
<i>you</i>; and though I dare say he could do it with perfect
safety, yet I think he might have reasons for wishing to be
excused.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>The
object of this extravagant demand at length comes out; and it
seems I was perfectly justified in doubting whether you were in
jest or earnest when you advanced it.&nbsp; &ldquo;All (you say)
that I here assert&rdquo; (and questions of a certain description
are the strongest of all assertions) &ldquo;is this; that your
Lordship, for whose head and heart I have the highest respect,
appears to have undertaken the patronage of you know not whom or
what.&rdquo; <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; Now, Sir, there is but one
portion of this <i>assertion</i> to which I have any
objection.&nbsp; His Lordship certainly does know <i>what</i> he
has undertaken to patronize; for to the circulation of the
Scriptures, the Scriptures as printed by authority, the
Scriptures without any addition, deduction, or variation, both
his patronage and that of the truly venerable characters
associated with him, are restrained.&nbsp; The rest of the
assertion is perfectly harmless.&nbsp; His Lordship has
undertaken the patronage of he <i>knows not whom</i>: this is
strictly true; nor would it be less so, if his Lordship filled
the chair of any other Society, or if the Country Clergyman and
his friends occupied the place of the six hundred members over
whom his Lordship <i>actually does</i> preside.</p>
<p>It seems, however, that if his Lordship does not know over
<i>whom</i> he presides, the Country Clergyman can tell
him.&nbsp; Lord T. does not know &ldquo;the <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>men and their
communication&rdquo; to whom he has joined himself; but you, it
should seem, can explain them both.&nbsp; No sooner do you cast
your eye over the List of Subscribers which his Lordship has sent
you, than you see &ldquo;a very large proportion&rdquo; of
persons &ldquo;with which, as an honest man,&rdquo; you
&ldquo;can have nothing to do;&rdquo; men of whose company you
&ldquo;have hitherto always been horribly afraid, being
frightened at the idea of having the national establishment blown
up, as one of them said, clergy and
all;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;wolves,&rdquo; who design to worry your
&ldquo;poor sheep;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;crafty beasts;&rdquo; and,
finally, &ldquo;those who openly and fairly avow that their
object is to eat up both sheep and shepherd.&rdquo; <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a>&nbsp; This is indeed, Sir, a very
alarming discovery; and I could almost wish, for the honor of the
Society, it had never been made.&nbsp; However, though I love the
Society much, I love truth more; and therefore, whatever
sacrifice it may cost me, I trust it will always prevail.</p>
<p>But now, Sir, though I make no doubt you believe every thing
you say, what ground have you for expecting that I should?&nbsp;
If you tell me you have seen a ghost, and that he frightened you
out of your wits, I may have the best reasons in the world for
believing that you have seen a ghost; and yet I may doubt all the
time whether there were a ghost to be seen.&nbsp; In like manner,
though <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>I
dare say you are a devout believer in the threats of these
incendiaries, the howlings of these wolves, and the voracious
declarations of these cannibals; yet, I may after all have
liberty to doubt, whether such stories are entitled to a
moment&rsquo;s regard.&nbsp; Travellers, you know, Sir, with the
best intentions in the world, often play a trick upon us; and I
think it very possible, that a Country Clergyman, with no worse
intentions, may be led to do the same.&nbsp; When Bruce described
the Abyssinian as cutting a steak from the rump of a living
animal, and then driving him on as if nothing had happened, the
world smiled at the easy credulity of the honest traveller, and
did not believe one particle of the matter: I am inclined to
think that the marvellous tales of the Country Clergyman will
scarcely meet with a better fate.</p>
<p>But let me, Sir, expostulate with you for a moment.&nbsp; I
know how unreasonable a passion fear is, and I think it is always
worth while to take every honest method of getting rid of it.</p>
<p>As a Country Clergyman, I dare say, you are a pretty good
horseman; and though I do not suspect you of appearing upon a
race-course, or galloping after the hounds, yet I suppose you are
no enemy to a pleasant ride.&nbsp; Now it must have happened to
you, at least once in your life, as well as to inferior horsemen,
to be in imminent danger of breaking your neck by the sudden and
unaccountable starting of your horse.&nbsp; Irritable and <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>overbearing
men will, you know, under such circumstances, make a furious
application of the whip and the spur to the back and sides of the
terrified animal.&nbsp; The consequence is, that if he was afraid
of the object at first, he will be &ldquo;horribly afraid&rdquo;
of it ever after.&nbsp; You and I know a better way; and that is,
to lead the animal up to the object which occasioned his alarm,
and to give him an opportunity of forming a more correct judgment
of it.&nbsp; I cannot help thinking, that if you had adopted some
such steps, under your first impressions of alarm at the
Subscribers to the Bible Society; if, without <i>venturing
yourself</i> &ldquo;into the company of men of whom you have
hitherto been always horribly afraid,&rdquo; you had yet
<i>ventured yourself</i> near enough to them, to see whether they
were likely men to blow you up in the air, or bury you in their
stomachs; you would have been saved from the humiliating
necessity of soliciting &ldquo;the charity of the Noble President
to pity your weakness and excuse your unconquerable fears.&rdquo;
<a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a></p>
<p>But let me tell you a story&mdash;A friend of mine (who by the
way is a Country Clergyman as well as yourself) was lately
invited to dine with a Mohawk Chief, of whose visit to this
country the provincial papers have doubtless informed you.&nbsp;
My friend was very much in your situation.&nbsp; His head was
full of stories against this &ldquo;denomination&rdquo; <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>of
people.&nbsp; He had been credibly assured, that they were
&ldquo;the enemies of all that is sober or established;&rdquo;
that they enjoyed nothing so much as pulling men&rsquo;s scalps
over their ears, and eating them up, <i>clothes and
all</i>.&nbsp; He could not therefore, for some time, be induced
to <i>venture himself</i> &ldquo;into the company of men of whom
he had hitherto been always horribly afraid.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
length, however, he was prevailed upon to accept the invitation;
not without some apprehensions on his own part, that he
&ldquo;should feel uneasy, and be illiberally, perhaps, looking
towards the door.&rdquo; <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a>&nbsp; How he
actually behaved, I am not told; but what do you think was the
event of his visit?&mdash;Why, he returned from the interview,
with his flesh upon his bones, his scalp upon his head, and not a
single mark of the tomahawk all over his body.&nbsp; Add to this,
he received so favorable an impression of this
&ldquo;denomination&rdquo; of people, that he resolved hereafter
to consider them as <i>brethren</i>, and to co-operate with them
in every object which might promise to promote their common
welfare, without interfering with their separate, local, and
independent interests.&nbsp; I leave the Country Clergyman to use
his discretion about trying such experiments as these; but,
whether he try them or not, I make no question, that, in many
cases, they would be attended with similar success.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>It
seems, however, that such Associations are forbidden by that
least forbidding of all the Christian graces,
<i>Charity</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Christian charity (you tell us) no
where recommends associations of discordant principles,
combinations of men professedly at variance and in hostility with
each other: but Christian charity enjoins that which renders all
these elaborate societies useless; it teaches and <i>obliges</i>
Christians to be <i>like-minded</i>, to have one faith, one
baptism, one speech, and one hope of their calling.&rdquo; <a
name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a>&nbsp; Now, Sir, though I am far from
thinking that you are singular in your notion of Christian
charity; for the church of Rome entertained the same opinions,
and does, I dare say, entertain them to this day&mdash;yet I
think you will have a difficulty in turning this notion to any
important use.&nbsp; The fact is, that Christian Charity, much as
she may <i>enjoin</i> an uniformity of opinion upon questions of
a controvertible nature, cannot succeed in effecting it without
the aid of those <i>compelling</i> means, of which she has been
so long deprived.&nbsp; From the time that some prototype of Lord
T. prevailed upon the church &ldquo;to throw away that natural
defence&rdquo; of whips, and screws, and faggots, &ldquo;which
God Almighty had given her,&rdquo; <a name="citation21b"></a><a
href="#footnote21b" class="citation">[21b]</a> Christian Charity
has assumed a new character, and taken up an employment the very
opposite to that in which she had been for ages before
engaged.&nbsp; Her <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>attention is now turned from the <i>heads</i> to the
<i>hearts</i> of men; and when she cannot succeed in making them
<i>like-minded</i>, she tries to make them <i>love one
another</i>.&nbsp; She is said to have actually disclaimed all
the sentiments and measures which were ascribed to her during her
alliance with the Holy Father.&nbsp; The account which is given
of the matter, is plausible enough; and as it does not appear to
have reached your ears, I will give it you just as I received
it.</p>
<p>Somewhere about the time when the churches of the West came
under the dominion of the Holy See, the successor of St. Peter
was observed to cool in his regard for <i>Charity</i>, and to
withdraw his affections very sensibly from <i>her</i>.&nbsp; The
cause of this decline in his attachment was at length
discovered.&nbsp; A rival, not unknown for many ages before, had
now acquired a very formidable ascendancy in the breast of the
Holy Pontiff; and the new attachment was not a little cherished
by the leading members of the subjugated church.&nbsp; The
influence of the favorite rapidly increased, and that of
<i>Charity</i> proportionably declined; till at length, matters
went so far that the latter was deposed and imprisoned, and the
former enthroned in her place.&nbsp; The name of <i>Bigotry</i>
(for so she had been called from her birth) was against her, and
so was her countenance.&nbsp; The first of these difficulties she
got over by assuming the name of her disgraced predecessor; the
latter, it is said, remains a <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>difficulty to this very day.&nbsp; In
the mean time, <i>Charity</i> continued immured in the closest
confinement; and when the monasteries were pulled down at the
Reformation, this queen of all the virtues was found pale and
almost lifeless in a subterraneous cell.&nbsp; Her health had
been so much impaired by confinement, and her character
misrepresented by the artifices of her rival, that it took her a
great deal of time to regain her strength and make herself
properly known.&nbsp; In both these respects she has now to a
great degree succeeded: and though the Pope denies her rights,
and many persons, who ought to know better, continue to question
them, yet her countenance and temper most clearly identify her
with that heavenly original, whose office it is to sanctify the
confidence of faith and the fervor of hope; and to make them the
instruments of promoting glory to God in the highest, and peace
and good-will among men.</p>
<p>Now though this looks very much like an allegorical account of
the matter, yet I think it accords so well with the fact, that I
trust both you and I shall be the better for the moral of
it.&nbsp; I am sure if I thought that uniformity of opinion upon
the details of Christianity, could be brought about among those
who agree in the fundamentals of it, I should rejoice to
contribute my proportion to the advancement of so desirable an
event.&nbsp; But I do not expect, what in the present
constitution of human nature I believe to be impossible.&nbsp; I
think <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>that
the nearest advances to such uniformity may be made by resolving
to unite as far as we are <i>like-minded</i>, and to be
reciprocally forbearing where we are <i>not</i>, and thus to
fulfil our Saviour&rsquo;s commandment of loving one
another.&nbsp; I am sure that if every Country Clergyman will
substitute this species of Charity for the adulterous idol which
you have set up (and I have little doubt but they will), the
church will then maintain herself in vigour, usefulness, and
beauty; &ldquo;and the gates of nonconformity&rdquo; <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a> will not prevail against her.</p>
<p>I have hitherto been reasoning upon the presumption, that
circulating the Holy Scriptures was an act upon the excellence of
which no question could arise between us; but it seems that I
have been mistaken: for his Lordship is cautioned (and every
member of the Society through him) not to be &ldquo;deceived with
the notion, that the <i>bare act of distributing Bibles</i>,
<i>is the act of disseminating truth</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b"
class="citation">[24b]</a></p>
<p>This species of caution, and the reasons by which it is
supported, have acquired so much the air of novelty by having
been shut up for more than two hundred years, that I confess I
was not a little struck with them; and I dare say, the feelings
of most of your readers will be in unison with mine.&nbsp; But I
will give the passage at length:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be not then deceived, my Lord, with the
notion that the <i>bare act of distributing Bibles is the </i><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span><i>act of
disseminating the sacred truth</i>.&nbsp; The word of God in
itself is pure, and perfect, and more to be desired than much
fine gold; but as the finest gold may be turned to base purposes,
so may the Scriptures.&nbsp; For, alas! through the lusts of men
and the covetousness of the world, the precious book of life is
made the instrument of error as well as of truth; of much evil as
well as of infinite good.&nbsp; When it is remembered that to the
Scriptures, not only the true church of Christ appeals for
confirmation of its divine doctrine; but likewise that every sect
and heresy, by which it ever was defaced, has regularly pretended
likewise to produce its error; when we observe the Papist, and
Puritan, the Socinian, and Calvinist, the Baptist, and Quaker,
all appealing to the Bible for the truth of their principles, and
pretending to prove them thereby;&mdash;it will not be
maintained, I think, that the <i>mere distribution of Bibles</i>
under the present circumstances of the times, is likely to spread
the truth.&nbsp; On the contrary, it is to be expected that each
member of your heterogeneous Society will draw his portion of
books for the promotion of his particular opinion; for it is
easily seen, that a Bible given away by a Papist, will be
productive of Popery.&nbsp; The Socinian will make his Bible
speak, and spread Socinianism; while the Calvinist, the Baptist,
and the Quaker, will teach the opinions peculiar to their
sects.&nbsp; Supply these <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>men with Bibles (I speak as to a true
churchman), and you supply them with arms against
yourself.&rdquo; <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really, Sir, in reading over this extraordinary morceau, which
I do assure you I have done again and again, I have found my
astonishment continually increase, and am now as much at a loss
as ever, to account for your raising up again those notions,
which have been buried by public authority for so many
ages.&nbsp; An old parishioner of mine, who scarcely reads any
books but the Bible and Fox&rsquo;s Martyrology, was ready to
swoon when she came to this part of your pamphlet; and I could
not, for the life of me, prevail upon her to go any
farther.&nbsp; She was utterly astonished at my being able to
smile at what she was pleased to call, the <i>rankest Popery she
had</i> ever read.&nbsp; I told her, it could not be Popery; for
it was written by a Country Clergyman: she said, the whole was a
trick; and that the Papists abounded in such tricks.&nbsp; It was
in vain that I repeated to her my conviction, that the author was
a Protestant Clergyman, and that, I feared, he was not singular
in holding these opinions: I could not get her to believe one
syllable of either.&nbsp; She persisted in her declaration, that,
whatever you might call yourself, you were some Romish Priest in
the interest of the Catholics; and that you only wanted to
prepare the people for parting with their Bibles.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Now,
Sir, though I by no means go the same lengths as my orthodox
parishioner, yet I am free to confess, that I agree with her in
the main.&nbsp; I dare believe, that you have no more intention
of bringing back the Pope than I have; and yet I do not know how
you could have written more to the purpose, if you had wished to
accomplish such a measure.&nbsp; The dangers which you point out
as accompanying the perusal of the Holy Scriptures by the
unlearned, were matters of constant anxiety to his Papal bosom
all the time that he acted as visible head of the English church;
and many a Country Clergyman was employed, under his direction,
to enforce upon Lords and Commoners that prudent caution against
<i>distributing Bibles</i>, which you so earnestly press upon the
Noble President of the British and Foreign Bible Society.&nbsp;
Our forefathers, however, were too much of his Lordship&rsquo;s
way of thinking to yield to such considerations: having derived
so much benefit from reading the Bible themselves, they would not
endure the thought of refusing it to others; and they were,
therefore, among the foremost &ldquo;to promote the circulation
of the Scriptures at home and abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lament with you that &ldquo;the Holy Book is made a nose of
wax;&rdquo; I, too, am &ldquo;<i>sadly</i> experiencing&rdquo;
this, &ldquo;daily before my eyes;&rdquo; <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> and, the strange interpretation which
you have given of <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>&ldquo;Christian Charity,&rdquo; is another proof of the
<i>sad</i> extent to which this practice has spread.&nbsp; But I
could not consent on that account to deprive <i>you</i> of your
Bible, nor even to refuse you another if you wanted it.&nbsp;
Indeed, Sir, the conduct which you blame, and of which you have
condescended to become an example, is a grievous evil: but the
remedy which you propose, and which the Council of Trent proposed
before you, is abundantly worse than the disease.</p>
<p>By the way, Sir, I wonder you were not a little afraid of
venturing such sentiments abroad, without first consulting those
of your friends who are better acquainted with the principles of
the Reformation than you appear to be.&nbsp; You talk of <i>the
church</i>, in the same language, with the same pride of
appropriation, and with the same prerogative of limiting the
course and interpretation of Scripture, as if you had never heard
that the church of Rome disputes all these things with you, or as
if you had never heard of a separation from her.&nbsp; Had no
such separation taken place, your observations would have been
perfectly in order.&nbsp; You might then have followed them up
too with this precautionary proposition, that Bibles should be
suppressed; and that every subject of the empire should engage
(in the language of the Douay Catechism) to &ldquo;believe
whatsoever the Catholic church proposes to be
believed.&rdquo;&nbsp; This would certainly (if it could have
been carried into effect) have rendered &ldquo;all such <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>elaborate
Societies&rdquo; as confine themselves to &ldquo;the <i>bare act
of distributing Bibles</i>, useless;&rdquo; and consequently the
growth of <i>heresy</i>, <i>error</i>, and <i>delusion</i>,
impossible.</p>
<p>But, Sir, you and I must take things as we find them: and it
does so happen, that things <i>are not</i>, in the church
established in these realms, as they <i>once were</i>.&nbsp;
Whether it be a wise or an unwise measure to open the Scriptures
to the people at large, it is now too late to dispute: to the
people at large they <i>are</i> opened; and their distribution is
legitimated both by canon and precedent, as an act of the
strictest justice, and the purest benevolence.</p>
<p>Indeed I must take upon myself to tell you, that your fears
for the church, from &ldquo;the circulation of the
Scriptures,&rdquo; are not calculated to do her any honor in the
world.&nbsp; She either does not think with you, that, in
supplying the different denominations of Christians with Bibles,
she is really supplying them &ldquo;with arms against
herself;&rdquo; or if she does, she has the magnanimity to
promote their salvation, though it were at her own expense.&nbsp;
I dare say you will set me down for no &ldquo;true
churchman,&rdquo; when I say this; but I will give you an
authority to this effect, which has much weight with me, and
which <i>you</i> will scarcely venture to dispute.&nbsp; In a
little tract, called &ldquo;Questions and Answers concerning the
respective Tenets of the Church of England and the Church of
Rome,&rdquo; I find the following passage:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>&ldquo;Question.&nbsp; Why do you find fault with the
church of <span class="smcap">Rome</span> for not suffering the
common people <i>to read the Bible</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer. 1.&nbsp; Because in so doing they act contrary
to the command Christ gives to <i>all</i>, &lsquo;Search the
Scriptures,&rsquo; John, v. 39.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; Because what they forbid, the Apostles
commend, as we see in the example of the Bereans, who are
<i>commended</i> for reading the Scriptures, Acts, xvii. 11.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; It is contrary to the practice of the
primitive church, in which the fathers <i>earnestly exhorted</i>
the people to an assiduous and diligent reading of the
Scriptures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; It agrees not with St. Paul&rsquo;s counsel
and exhortation, 1 Thess. v. 7.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>I charge you</i>
that this Epistle be read to all the holy brethren.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;5.&nbsp; It was a duty of the Jews to have the law in
their houses, and to read it to their children, Deut. vi. 7, and
therefore must be much more the duty of Christians to read or
peruse the Gospel, as being a people living under a greater and
richer economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6.&nbsp; Whereas it is pretended that the Scriptures
are obscure, and that this prohibition is <i>to prevent
heresies</i>: <i>we</i> answer, that the Scriptures are not so
obscure, in places relating to things necessary to salvation, but
that they may be understood by the laity: and as to the plea of
<i>preventing heresies</i>, that is only a pretence, no argument,
since <i>they </i><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span><i>might as well forbid people to eat and drink</i>,
<i>for</i>, <i>fear they should abuse that
liberty</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, as this tract is issued by the Society for promoting
Christian Knowledge, I cannot but think it a misfortune, that, as
a <i>Country Clergyman</i>, you should not have seen it before
you wrote your Address to Lord T.: you would scarcely then have
challenged the Noble Lord to show that he was &ldquo;a true
churchman,&rdquo; by fearing and restraining the circulation of
the Scriptures.&nbsp; As it is, you can scarcely, I should think,
expect to escape rebuke.&nbsp; Like that &ldquo;officer of the
Society,&rdquo; <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a> whose secret history you seem to have
studied so well, you have stepped a little out of your regular
line, and, like him too, have been guilty of some
&ldquo;indecorum towards the church and its spiritual
superiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But supposing, Sir, that I could admit your dubious
proposition, that the dissemination of truth did not depend upon
the <i>Bible</i> which was given, but upon the <i>hand</i> which
might give it; a proposition, which, if true to the extent of
your statement, would prove equally, that the effect of your
pamphlet upon the interests of the Bible Society will depend less
upon the merits of your work, than upon the hands through which
it may pass;&mdash;what expedient would you propose, in the
exercise of your sagacity, for providing against the consequences
you fear?&nbsp; I am aware of your
answer&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Dissolve the Bible
Society</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Suppose that <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>done; though there would, I think, be
difficulties in the way of doing it: still the tares are sowing
in a thousand directions, and the business of prevention is
scarcely yet begun.&nbsp; Your expedient must provide for putting
Bibles into the hands of churchmen <i>only</i>, or of those who
will <i>infallibly</i> become churchmen by reading them; or it
will never succeed.&nbsp; But what will you do with those
wholesale Bible-mongers, the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge, and his Majesty&rsquo;s Printer, and all their
subordinate agents and instruments, the book and Bible sellers
throughout the country?&nbsp; While such merchants as these may
dispose of Bibles <i>ad libitum</i> as an article of trade, and
such bodies as the Society for promoting Christian Knowledge, and
others of the same description, will continue to favor the
traffic, I cannot see how you will contrive to dam up the waters
of life to any orthodox purpose; or to prevent their irrigating
those lands that are alienated from the established church.</p>
<p>Perhaps it might forward your purpose to put the printing and
distributing of Bibles under some new and more definite
limitation.&nbsp; As the members of the church of England do not
exceed four fifths of the population of the country, and the
chance of converting a sectary is scarcely worth the risk of
supplying him with &ldquo;arms against yourself,&rdquo; what
think you of a petition to the Legislature against uselessly and
dangerously multiplying <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>copies of the Holy Scriptures?&nbsp;
I will suppose your application successful, and that only four
Bibles are printed for every five individuals upon the records of
the population.&nbsp; I will also suppose, which is quite as
necessary, that these Bibles, when printed, are consigned to an
ecclesiastical depot, of which the whole and sole custody shall
be vested in the Country Clergyman; and that not a single copy of
the Bible shall be issued but under his direction.&nbsp; And now,
Sir, do you really think, that, &ldquo;old as you are in the
business,&rdquo; you would be able to detect all <i>the dogs</i>
that, under various disguises, would be seeking <i>the
children&rsquo;s meat</i>?&nbsp; If you find in the little range
of your own parish such &ldquo;hard work with these crafty
beasts,&rdquo; how much would your work be increased, and your
difficulties multiplied, by the daily care of all the
churches?</p>
<p>But you must go farther, Sir, or else you had better not have
begun.&mdash;You must interdict the free circulation of all
&ldquo;Apologies for the Bible,&rdquo; all dissertations upon its
authenticity and evidence, and particularly all discourses upon
its excellence and usefulness.&nbsp; You must prevail upon the
many venerable prelates, archdeacons&rsquo;, and priests, of the
present day, who have done themselves so much honor by advocating
the cause of Christianity, to expunge from their writings all
unguarded commendations of the Holy Scriptures; or to provide for
their works, if they know how, an exclusive <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>circulation
in ecclesiastical channels.&nbsp; Nor is this all: you must
invite, solicit, and (if you can find the means) compel, all the
different denominations of Christians, to deliver up forthwith
the Bibles they possess into the hands of the nearest parish
priest.&nbsp; When all this is accomplished (and until it is,
your end will be very imperfectly obtained) it will only remain
for those well-meaning Societies, in connexion with the
established church, to ask a bill of indemnity for the degree in
which they have contributed to the propagation of error, by their
incautious distribution of Bibles; and to bind themselves over to
commit no more such acts of ecclesiastical suicide.&nbsp; Your
business, it shall be supposed, is now accomplished; and what is
the result?&mdash;Why, you may now congratulate yourself upon
having withdrawn the <i>antidote</i> and left the <i>poison</i>
in circulation; for the different denominations of Christians are
still in possession of the privilege of multiplying <i>tracts</i>
ad infinitum, and you have deprived their readers of the only
means of detecting the <i>heresy</i> they contain.</p>
<p>But really, Sir, to be serious&mdash;&ldquo;I feel very strong
objections to the whole plan, not indeed the simple, pure object
of&rdquo; securing the Scriptures from perversion; &ldquo;the
mischief lies in the <i>manner</i> and means,&rdquo; which must
at all events be employed for &ldquo;carrying that object into
effect.&rdquo; <a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a></p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>The
word of God, which is a savour of life unto life, <i>may</i>
also, I know, become a savour of death unto death.&nbsp; I am
sorry for it: but to restrain the circulation of it, in order to
provide against this <i>contingent</i> evil, would, I continue to
think, with the authority before cited, be at once as
unreasonable and unjust, as to &ldquo;forbid people to eat or
drink, for fear they should abuse that liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am really sorry, Sir, you were so much at a loss to
interpret the meaning of that &ldquo;liberal basis,&rdquo; upon
which his Lordship recommended the Society to your notice.&nbsp;
The terms &ldquo;broad bottom,&rdquo; <a
name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a> which you substitute in their place,
would have expressed well enough his Lordship&rsquo;s intention;
but as he was writing to a <i>Country Clergyman</i>, and not to
&ldquo;a preaching blacksmith,&rdquo; he would not &ldquo;fail in
the respect&rdquo; that is due to &ldquo;a gentleman and a
Christian.&rdquo; <a name="citation35b"></a><a
href="#footnote35b" class="citation">[35b]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;Those
who are used to good company (you say) know how to behave.&rdquo;
<a name="citation35c"></a><a href="#footnote35c"
class="citation">[35c]</a>&nbsp; What then is his Lordship to
think of <i>you</i>, when you tell him, that you have &ldquo;not
been educated on liberal-basis&rsquo;d or broad-bottomed
principles,&rdquo; <a name="citation35d"></a><a
href="#footnote35d" class="citation">[35d]</a> but that either
you have not put on your prettiest behaviour, or that you would
&ldquo;feel&rdquo; less &ldquo;uneasy,&rdquo; than you pretend,
in that class of company to which, as a member of the Bible
Society, you would expect to be introduced?</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>But
were there no other authorities to which you could have recourse,
when the lexicographer failed you, than the mouths of the
&ldquo;<i>vulgar</i>?&rdquo; <a name="citation36"></a><a
href="#footnote36" class="citation">[36]</a>&nbsp; I have an
authority before me, which throws so much more light upon his
Lordship&rsquo;s &ldquo;liberal basis,&rdquo; than either the
synonyms of the &ldquo;lexicographer,&rdquo; the slang of the
&ldquo;vulgar,&rdquo; or the etymological quirks of the
&ldquo;Country Clergyman,&rdquo; that I shall make no apology for
producing it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Give us all grace, to put away from us all
rancour of religious dissension, that they who agree in the
essentials of our most holy faith, and look for pardon through
the merits and intercession of the Saviour, may, notwithstanding
the differences upon points of doubtful opinion, and in the forms
of external worship, still be united in the bonds of Christian
charity, and fulfil thy blessed Son&rsquo;s commandment, of
loving one another as he hath loved them.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Form of
Prayer for the Fast</i>, <i>October</i> 19, 1803.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now here, Sir, I found that &ldquo;liberal basis&rdquo; upon
which the Society is erected, and I am surprised you did not
think of looking for it in the same place.&nbsp; But perhaps the
liberal basis of the prayer, like that of the Society, &ldquo;has
no charms for&rdquo; <i>you</i>.&nbsp; I will not presume such a
fact; but if you <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>were to affirm that it is so, I should have very little
difficulty in believing you.</p>
<p>You do not however intend &ldquo;to deny the possibility of
any <i>sort or degree</i> of union among certain descriptions of
persons composing the Society.&rdquo; <a
name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a"
class="citation">[37a]</a>&nbsp; You are &ldquo;perfectly aware
that all the various and discordant tribes of dissenters from the
church of England may unite from the Papist down to the Quaker;
for they frequently have, and frequently do unite <i>against</i>
the church.&rdquo; <a name="citation37b"></a><a
href="#footnote37b" class="citation">[37b]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;But
when (say you) was it ever known that they have united
<i>with</i> the church?&nbsp; Show me the history, lay your
finger on the page, and say, my Lord, <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>,
and upon what <i>occasion</i>, did they ever unite <i>with</i>
the church for any important and righteous design.&nbsp; I must
be satisfied on this point; I must request some fair example and
precedent, to prove that the thing is neither impossible nor
improbable, before it can be even prudent to listen to your
Lordship&rsquo;s proposal.&rdquo; <a name="citation37c"></a><a
href="#footnote37c" class="citation">[37c]</a></p>
<p>Now here, Sir, you throw out a challenge, which, with his
Lordship&rsquo;s permission, I am willing to accept.&nbsp; I will
show you the history of such union as you indirectly deny: I will
lay my finger on the page, and say, <i>when</i>, and
<i>where</i>, and upon what <i>occasion</i> the different tribes
of Dissenters <i>did</i> unite with the church for an important
and righteous design.&nbsp; The <i>history</i> then to which I
refer is that portion of our country&rsquo;s annals which <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>commenced
with the autumn of 1803, and which is not yet completed.&nbsp;
The <i>page</i> upon which I lay my finger is that which displays
the voluntary creation of a national force; in which, if one
feature was more illustrious than another, it was the magnanimity
with which the subjects of the same government agreed &ldquo;to
put away all rancour of religious dissension,&rdquo; and to unite
in the prosecution of that <i>righteous</i> and <i>important</i>
design in which they had embarked, &ldquo;notwithstanding their
differences upon points of doubtful opinion, and in the forms of
external worship.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let the Country Clergyman peruse
this awful yet luminous page of our history; let him weigh well
the danger which threatened the throne, the church, and the
nation; let him read in those discourses, which gratitude will
not allow us to forget, how that danger was proclaimed by
preachers of every denomination; let him walk through the land,
in the length of it and the breadth of it, and see how many
myriads were added to the national force by those powerful and
seasonable appeals to the feelings, the conscience, and the
spirit of Britons; and he will want, I think, no other
&ldquo;example and precedent&rdquo; to prove that an union of the
various tribes of Dissenters <span class="GutSmall">WITH</span>
the church of England, for an important and righteous design,
&ldquo;is neither impossible nor improbable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With such a recent portion of history before your eyes, I
cannot see, I confess, either the <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>justice or the policy of your
travelling back over a century and half of ground in order to
find matter of accusation against those of our fellow-subjects,
with whom a sense of common danger has united us, and with whom
it is as important now as it was two years ago, that we should
continue united.&nbsp; The politico-religious strife which
subsisted between our ancestors and theirs is not a sacred
inheritance.&nbsp; I trust the various denominations of
Christians of the present day would think themselves as much
disgraced by the events of &ldquo;the grand rebellion,&rdquo; <a
name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a"
class="citation">[39a]</a> as the modern members of the
establishment would by the revenge with which it was
followed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The church&rdquo; has, I know, &ldquo;her
sores and scars;&rdquo; and so, I lament to say, have those who
dissented from her.&nbsp; Let us own the truth&mdash;&ldquo;the
heavenly dove&rdquo; <a name="citation39b"></a><a
href="#footnote39b" class="citation">[39b]</a> has been sometimes
encouraged to make a little too free with &ldquo;the wings and
feathers&rdquo; of the smaller birds, and it must not therefore
be wondered if her own have suffered.&nbsp; Let her but act up to
the sweetness of her nature, and allow the other tenants of the
air to have their note; she then may plume her golden breast
without annoyance, and bear her grateful blessings on
outstretched wings to every nation under heaven.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Your
zeal for extending the boundaries of that church in which you
minister, is both natural and just: I participate in it with all
the feelings of my heart.&nbsp; It is an object which has my
prayers, and shall, by God&rsquo;s assistance, through life
command my services.&nbsp; But I will not set her up as the
entire and only spouse of Christ: for how can I then curse those
whom God hath not cursed?&mdash;Away with those superannuated
fears, that she must grow barren because her younger sisters are
fruitful.&nbsp; I have no doubt but both she and they have
&ldquo;borne many an illustrious child of God&rdquo; <a
name="citation40a"></a><a href="#footnote40a"
class="citation">[40a]</a> to their heavenly bridegroom, and will
continue to bear many more.&nbsp; I lament with you, that they
prefer their <i>Gerizim</i> to our <i>Zion</i>: but I must not
therefore refuse to have any dealings <a
name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b"
class="citation">[40b]</a> with them, or to entertain any charity
for them.&nbsp; If they worship God in spirit and truth, if with
the heart they believe on the Lord Jesus unto righteousness, if
they &ldquo;agree in the essentials of our most holy faith, and
look for pardon through the merits and intercession of the
Saviour,&rdquo; I cannot, I dare not, I will not put them out of
the covenant of grace and mercy and peace.&nbsp; Aliens from our
external commonwealth, they are yet fellow-citizens with the
saints: and though the earthly Jerusalem disclaim them, they will
hereafter be acknowledged by the Jerusalem above&mdash;the mother
of us all. <a name="citation40c"></a><a href="#footnote40c"
class="citation">[40c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>But the
treason can no longer be dissembled; the eleventh article of the
Society&rsquo;s constitution proclaims it: that article purports,
that &ldquo;the committee (which is to conduct the business of
the Society, appoint all officers except the treasurer, have
power to call special meetings, and are charged with procuring
for the Society suitable patronage) shall consist of thirty-six
laymen; of whom, twenty-four, who shall have most frequently
attended, shall be eligible for re-election for the ensuing year;
six shall be foreigners resident in London or its vicinity; half
the remainder shall be members of the church of England, and the
other half members of other denominations of
Christians!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We have here</i> (say you) <i>a standing majority
against the church</i>!&rdquo; and then, after declaiming, with
all the art of the buskin, upon this &ldquo;death-warrant of the
established church,&rdquo; and with all the prescience of the
seer upon the return of the &ldquo;halcyon days of 1648,&rdquo;
you surround yourself with the imaginary ruins of
&ldquo;our&rdquo; demolished &ldquo;Zion,&rdquo; and make your
exit &ldquo;weeping.&rdquo; <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a>&nbsp; I thought
indeed when you played such awkward antics upon &ldquo;his
Lordship&rsquo;s liberal basis,&rdquo; that every thing was not
right.&nbsp; I could not but regard the laugh in which you
indulged, as a symptom of something very different from humour;
and I <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>have
not been deceived.&nbsp; It was, I perceive, a <i>moody
laugh</i>, and has ended, as all such hysterical affections do,
in <i>a flood of tears</i>.&nbsp; As the fit is now over, we may
examine this treasonable article, with a better chance of coming
to a mutual understanding upon it.</p>
<p>I will then indulge you for a moment with the full benefit of
your assertion, that there is in this committee &ldquo;<i>a
standing majority against the church</i>;&rdquo; and what will
you gain by such a concession?&nbsp; The object, you must now
bear in mind, is specific&mdash;the circulation of the
Scriptures; that object, you must also recollect, is limited,
within the kingdom, to the <i>authorized</i>, versions in use
among us.&nbsp; The same sort of limitation is not resorted to in
case of foreign versions, for the best of all reasons; that it
<i>cannot</i> in the nature of things be applied.&nbsp; The
different Protestant churches on the European continent have
their authorized versions, and <i>there</i> the line of
proceeding is direct: but where the church of Rome, or, as she
calls herself <i>the church</i>, prevails; <i>there</i>, the
Country Clergyman would scarcely wish the rule for circulating
the <i>authorized</i> version to be observed.&nbsp; As for those
languages into which translations remain to be made, they are for
the most part so remote from the ordinary sphere of study and
commerce, that the office of executing such translations, and
judging of their merits, must generally be consigned to
foreigners; who probably <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>neither understand the distinctions
to which we annex importance, nor could be made to understand
them.&nbsp; No questions, therefore, can arise in this committee,
which might bring into discussion the points of disagreement
between the church of England and Dissenters: so that if there
should be in such committee, a standing majority of members
<i>out of</i> the church, that will by no means constitute a
Standing majority <i>against</i> her.</p>
<p>But let us see whether your <i>hypothesis</i> does not assume
rather too much.&nbsp; The Society is denominated <i>British</i>
and <i>Foreign</i>.&nbsp; In the constitution of its committee,
it was but just to pay respect to both parts of its designation:
nor does it appear extravagant to have assigned a sixth part of
that committee to the members of those foreign churches, with
which the Society sought a friendly co-operation, and with which,
I understand, she <i>is</i> actually co-operating to a very
considerable extent.&nbsp; Now these foreigners cannot be
identified with the Dissenters from the established church,
without as much violence to speech as makes a <i>solecism</i>,
and to the rights of hospitality, as constitutes a
<i>calumny</i>.&nbsp; Neither these men have sinned, nor their
parents, in the way which the Country Clergyman <i>supposes</i>:
they brought their religion with them, as they did their
language; and they might as truly be said to have dissented from
a language which they never spake, as from a mode of religious
worship which neither they nor their fathers ever
professed.&nbsp; They <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>are, it should be observed, for the
most part members of sister churches, from which the Society for
promoting Christian Knowledge has obtained some of its most
laborious missionaries, and the established church of this
country has derived, and must continue to derive, her nursing
mothers. <a name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44"
class="citation">[44]</a>&nbsp; On many grounds, these foreigners
would feel the ties which bind them to the established church;
and she may therefore fairly reckon upon their <i>neutrality</i>,
if she may not promise herself their <i>support</i>.</p>
<p>Let these <i>neutrals</i> (for such <i>at least</i> I am
privileged to call them) be withdrawn, and there remain fifteen
members to support the church&rsquo;s interests, and fifteen, as
it is supposed by the Country Clergyman, to impugn them.&nbsp;
The former will naturally be links of the same chain; common
interest, and pledges of a peculiar nature, dictate to them an
uniformity of reciprocal support, from which they may not be
expected to depart.&nbsp; They may therefore be reckoned upon to
the extent of their number.&nbsp; But will you, Sir, who seem to
know something of the world, will you allow yourself to believe,
that the same uniformity of co-operation may be expected from the
fifteen members who are to fight the battles of
<i>dissent</i>?&nbsp; Some among them are advocates for
<i>infant</i> baptism, some for <i>adult</i> baptism, and some
for <i>no</i> baptism at all.&nbsp; Some <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>hold the
tenets of Calvin, some of Arminius, and some of neither.&nbsp;
Their sentiments upon church government are also scarcely less
various, than their opinions upon matters of faith: so that,
widely as they may seem to dissent from the church of England,
many of them would be found, if controverted questions could
arise, to differ still more widely from each other.&nbsp; Yet all
these discordant members must harmonize together; and the
foreigners, who probably differ from them all, must harmonize
with them; or else <i>the standing majority against the
church</i> must remain a mere <i>standing</i> bugbear, to scare
the Country Clergyman, and terrify those who choose to
participate his alarms.</p>
<p>I am, however, no enemy to strong improbabilities where a
pleasant argument is concerned.&nbsp; The fifteen members of all
denominations of British Christians <i>shall</i> unite together;
the six members of foreign churches shall do the same: and then,
like the miraculous pieces of St. Peter&rsquo;s chain <a
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a> (of which <i>the church</i> makes such
notable mention), these two parties shall form a junction; <i>a
majority</i> shall thus be created <i>against</i> the
church.&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Are not the presidents,
vice-presidents, and treasurer, by virtue of their respective
offices, members of the committee?&nbsp; Suppose then for a
moment, that the committee should entertain <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>so foul a
proposition as that for &ldquo;blowing up the establishment,
clergy and all;&rdquo; suppose, that the Quakers should consent
to renounce, <i>pro h&acirc;c vice</i>, their objections to the
employment of gunpowder; suppose further that the foreigners
should concur, nobody knows why, in voting for such a measure;
the terrified minority would not be without a remedy.&nbsp; It
would still be in their power, by the accession of these honorary
members, to outnumber their dissenting adversaries at the ensuing
meeting; and, by objecting to the confirmation of the minutes,
prevent the explosion of this nefarious plot.&nbsp; But indeed
there is no end of remedies.&nbsp; Every clergyman subscribing a
guinea a year, is a <i>member of the committee</i>. (Art.
12.)&nbsp; Every subscriber of five guineas a year, is a
<i>member of the committee</i>. (Art. 5 and 7.)&nbsp; Every
subscriber of 50<i>l.</i> at one time, is a <i>member of the
committee</i>. (Art. 6.)&nbsp; And lastly, every executor paying
a bequest of 100<i>l.</i> is a <i>member of the committee</i>.
(Art. 8 and 7.)&nbsp; Now, Sir, supposing the members of the
church of England to be (upon your own estimate) to those of
other denominations as four to one, <i>whose</i> fault do you
think it will be, if the balance of influence in the committee of
the Bible Society should be against her?&nbsp; Will <i>you</i> be
wholly innocent?&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, Sir, how could you join in such
a plot?&nbsp; What could induce you to lend your&rdquo;
professional &ldquo;name to such a business as this?&nbsp; And
why should you think so basely of the clergy as <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>to tempt them
by your example,&rdquo; and the presumption of your fair
reputation, to believe, that, in strengthening the hands of their
ecclesiastical brethren, they would &ldquo;sign the death-warrant
of the established church, and the instrument of their own
ruin?&rdquo; <a name="citation47a"></a><a href="#footnote47a"
class="citation">[47a]</a>&nbsp; Do, Sir, lose no time in writing
your palinodia.&nbsp; I will not ask you to alter your opinion of
the Society, or to part with one of your suspicions of its
mischievous designs.&nbsp; You shall still be at liberty to talk,
as freely as ever, of &ldquo;preaching blacksmiths and fanatical
ranters in holy orders;&rdquo; and of such &ldquo;doves,&rdquo;
as you and your friends, becoming &ldquo;a luscious and inviting
morsel to all the several hungry denominations of
Christians;&rdquo; provided you do but seek to multiply the
number of our ecclesiastical subscribers, as much as you have
hitherto laboured to diminish it.&nbsp; I will not promise, in
return, that your &ldquo;liberality will be sounded forth by
every gospel-preacher in the church, and every twanging teacher
in the conventicle;&rdquo; <a name="citation47b"></a><a
href="#footnote47b" class="citation">[47b]</a> but I may then
venture to promise you, what I should think would afford you
quite as much pleasure&mdash;the satisfaction of having converted
a standing majority <i>against</i> the church into a standing
majority <i>in her favor</i>.</p>
<p>I will not dispute with you, whether the established church
will be a gainer by this new connexion on the score of
<i>dignity</i> and fashion.&nbsp; I am <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>told, indeed, that there are among
the nonconformists those who can wear as gay a coat, play as good
a hand at whist, and give as modish an account of an opera or a
play, as &ldquo;those men of the world&rdquo; among us, who
&ldquo;think it more creditable to be accounted members of our
venerable church, than a subscriber to the meeting-house:&rdquo;
but I cannot say how many there may be of this description among
the subscribers to the Bible Society.&nbsp; However, though
&ldquo;few men of opulence, and fewer still of rank, frequent the
meeting-house or conventicle,&rdquo; there is &ldquo;influence
and consideration&rdquo; <a name="citation48a"></a><a
href="#footnote48a" class="citation">[48a]</a> enough among the
members of our communion to give respectability to both.&nbsp; I
grant, indeed, that &ldquo;the presence of <i>a nobleman</i>
cannot make the company which he honours with his presence either
creditable or polite,&rdquo; yet surely the presence of a
<i>number</i> will go a great way towards doing it: but then I
admit with you, that they must not be &ldquo;wandering
stars,&rdquo; <a name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a> which shed a momentary lustre, but
luminaries which keep a <i>fixed</i> position, and dispense a
<i>certain</i> light.</p>
<p>You expect, as the result of this new association, that all
will become unity, and charity, and Christian benevolence, and
that you shall see &ldquo;realized the pretty hand-in-hand
frontispiece to the Christian Ladies Pocket-Book 1803.&rdquo; <a
name="citation48c"></a><a href="#footnote48c"
class="citation">[48c]</a>&nbsp; Now though I am not so sanguine
in my expectations <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>as you are, yet I trust you will not be wholly
disappointed.&nbsp; And, in my opinion, a Protestant clergy will
be not acting less out of their character by promoting
&ldquo;unity, charity, and Christian benevolence,&rdquo; than by
disturbing them: nor can Christian prelates be quite so much
disgraced by shaking the hands of Dissenting ministers in the
frontispiece of a pocket-book, <a name="citation49"></a><a
href="#footnote49" class="citation">[49]</a> as they would be if
represented as drawing those hands through the holes of a
pillory.</p>
<p>Your fears are awakened for the <i>purity</i> of the
church:&mdash;I am certainly more tender of her <i>purity</i>
than I am of her <i>dignity</i>; and that because I have been
taught to regard her <i>white raiment</i> as her truest
<i>glory</i>.&nbsp; But what defilement has she to apprehend from
a co-operation with persons differing from her, in an object upon
which they are agreed?&nbsp; If Socinians are to be feared, if
Calvinists are to be shunned, I question whether the Bible
Society will furnish dangers nearly so great as those which the
established church incurs from members of her own
communion.&nbsp; Socinians are <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>not remarkable for their zeal in
promoting the circulation of the Scriptures; and I question
whether half a dozen of them have subscribed their names as
members of the Bible Society.&nbsp; As for the Calvinists, they
constitute, it must be remembered, only a proportion of those
denominations which are represented in the committee.&nbsp; The
Wesleian Methodists are not <i>Calvinists</i>; many of the
Presbyterians are not <i>Calvinists</i>; the Quakers are not
<i>Calvinists</i>; the Lutherans are not <i>Calvinists</i>; and
individuals of other persuasions, which might be named, are not
<i>Calvinists</i>.&nbsp; Besides, though &ldquo;scratchings and
fightings&rdquo; may be &ldquo;usual with the parties when on the
outside of the tavern walls,&rdquo; <a name="citation50"></a><a
href="#footnote50" class="citation">[50]</a> that is not a reason
for there being theological wranglings within.&nbsp; The line of
business is, with few exceptions, as direct at the Bible
Committee as it is at Lloyd&rsquo;s; and there is as little
reason to expect the peculiar tenets of Calvin or Socinus to
enter into a debate for dispersing an edition of the Scriptures,
as there would be if the same men were met to underwrite a policy
of insurance.&nbsp; But why may it not be hoped that churchmen
will not be the only losers by this connexion?&nbsp; What if some
of <i>us</i> should grow less proud and phlegmatic, may not some
of <i>them</i> become less snarlish and fanatical?&nbsp; The
friction which takes off our asperities will assuredly do the
same by theirs.&nbsp; It is <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>therefore highly probable, that we
may severally bring away with us our faith, our hope, and our
charity, which are all we wish to save; and leave nothing behind
us but that &ldquo;bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour,
and evil-speaking, and malice,&rdquo; <a
name="citation51a"></a><a href="#footnote51a"
class="citation">[51a]</a> which can very well be spared.</p>
<p>You ask, &ldquo;what concord hath a mitre with a
meeting-house?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Pharisees of old were fond of
asking questions of the same sort&mdash;&ldquo;Why eateth your
Master with publicans and sinners?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Pharisees
were very little satisfied with the answer they received; and, I
dare say, any answer that could be given to the Country Clergyman
would satisfy him as little.&nbsp; I must therefore leave him to
doubt whether <i>any concord</i> can subsist between kindred
souls, pursuing the same object under different forms, and in
unequal stations, till he shall see how near the spirits of an
Usher and a Baxter, of a Taylor and a Henry, of a Tillotson and a
Watts, of a Seeker and a Doddridge, will <i>venture</i> to
approach each other, in the new heaven and new earth wherein
dwelleth <i>righteousness</i>.</p>
<p>And pray what are we to understand by your merry question
about the <i>unequal yoke</i>?&nbsp; &ldquo;Why (you ask) should
a clergyman of the church of England be unequally yoked with a
lovely sister of the conventicle?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then you
desire &ldquo;a certain officer of the Society&rdquo; <a
name="citation51b"></a><a href="#footnote51b"
class="citation">[51b]</a> to be consulted.&nbsp; What <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>sort of an
answer that &ldquo;officer&rdquo; might think proper to give, it
belongs to himself to determine; but I confess I see nothing in
the question which I should be afraid to meet.&nbsp; I am at a
loss to see what harm &ldquo;a lovely sister of the
conventicle&rdquo; can do to any man.&nbsp; I am sure there is
every probability that such an &ldquo;unequal yoke&rdquo; would
do the Country Clergyman&rsquo;s temper a great deal of
good.&nbsp; But I cannot give him any great encouragement, if he
should <i>venture himself</i> upon such a speculation, <i>into
the company of those of whom he has always hitherto been horribly
afraid</i>.&nbsp; The sectaries, on whom he has laid such heavy
blows, will keep (I fear) their &ldquo;lovely sisters&rdquo; for
priests of a gentler nature and better breeding; and leave the
Country Clergyman to whisper his tale of love into some
high-church ear, and to be as &ldquo;equally yoked&rdquo; as
Richard Hooker, <a name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a> or any other country clergyman ever was
before him.</p>
<p>But though I can pardon in this &ldquo;certain officer <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>of the
Society,&rdquo; his <i>hymeneal</i> error (for matches, you know,
Sir, are made in heaven), yet I have no such allowance to make
for those other transgressions, in which he is, or ought to be, a
freer agent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps (you say) he can resolve us,
how a clergyman of the church can attend the meeting-house,
without danger to his principles, or gross indecorum towards the
church and its spiritual superior.&nbsp; He perhaps can show us
too, how a clergyman of the church can securely, and without
breach of trust, take his pupils to hear the harangues of those
who daily revile her.&nbsp; This, to common understandings, does
not appear to be the likely way &lsquo;to banish and drive away
all erroneous and strange doctrines, contrary to God&rsquo;s
word,&rsquo; which every clergyman at his ordination solemnly
promises to do.&nbsp; It wants some clearing up.&rdquo; <a
name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a></p>
<p>There is really, Sir, no accounting for the fancies of some of
our order.&nbsp; Dean Swift was fond of vulgar manners, and
therefore he would take his dinner in a cellar; some clergymen
love the sports of the field, and therefore join the hounds at a
fox-chase: I suppose this &ldquo;certain officer of the
Society&rdquo; has a sort of ear for public speaking, and has
sometimes stepped a little out of his way in order to gratify
it.&nbsp; But then (as you might naturally say) are not the
<i>theatres</i> open for <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>him, as well as for his brethren; and
if he wants a slice of good oratory, cannot he give six shillings
to a box-keeper, and take it like a gentleman?&nbsp; <i>He</i>
may perhaps have a doubt (for he seems to hold opinions of his
own) &ldquo;how a clergyman of the church can attend&rdquo;
<i>the theatre</i>, &ldquo;without danger to his principles, or
gross indecorum towards the church and its spiritual
superior.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps also he may entertain a doubt
&ldquo;how a clergyman of the church can, securely, and without
breach of trust, take his pupils to hear the harangues of
those&rdquo; dramatic characters, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; as
Archbishop Tillotson says, &ldquo;do most notoriously minister to
infidelity and vice.&rdquo; <a name="citation54a"></a><a
href="#footnote54a" class="citation">[54a]</a>&nbsp; Possibly
&ldquo;this,&rdquo; to his understanding, may &ldquo;not appear
to be the likely way &lsquo;to frame and fashion himself and his
family according to the doctrine of Christ, and to make both
himself and them, as much as in him lieth, wholesome examples and
patterns to the flock of Christ,&rsquo; <a
name="citation54b"></a><a href="#footnote54b"
class="citation">[54b]</a> which every clergyman at his
ordination solemnly promises to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I think with
you, that the whole of this matter &ldquo;wants clearing
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have, I confess, some difficulty about
conceiving how this priest can execute either such, or so many
duties as he is said to do, of a parochial and domestic nature;
and yet find either time to conduct his pupils to hear <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>the church
reviled, or pupils tractable enough to be conducted by him.&nbsp;
But, as I said before, the whole matter &ldquo;wants clearing
up;&rdquo; and if you should be found to have aimed a blow at his
professional character, which he has not quite deserved, you have
nothing to do but to say, as the Roman assassins are reported to
do when they stab the wrong man in the dark, &ldquo;<i>Padrone
&egrave; un sbaglio</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I beg your pardon,
it was <i>a mistake</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your last objection respects &ldquo;the purity of the Holy
Scriptures,&rdquo; which, you think, will be endangered &ldquo;if
the translation and edition of the Sacred Book are to be
intrusted to all the different denominations of
Christians.&rdquo; <a name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a>&nbsp; The greater part of this
objection has been anticipated.&nbsp; It has been already stated
that the Society is restrained to editing and distributing the
versions, <i>printed by authority</i>, throughout the united
kingdom.&nbsp; In supplying the different parts of the European
continent, the Society will find the versions already in
circulation among the Protestant churches; and its proceedings in
these cases will be chiefly directed by those Lutheran prelates
and ministers, with whom a confidential communication has, I
understand, been already opened, through the medium of its
foreign secretary.&nbsp; Nor can there be any danger of the Bible
Society intrusting &ldquo;either the translating or the editing
the Holy Scriptures to <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the care of that denomination of
Christians called Papists;&rdquo; <a name="citation56a"></a><a
href="#footnote56a" class="citation">[56a]</a> for, besides the
<i>improbability</i> of &ldquo;that denomination of
Christians&rdquo; joining the Bible Society, there is the
absolute <i>certainty</i>, that there would always be in the
committee a <i>standing majority against them</i>.&nbsp; With
regard to <i>new</i> translations, they relate, as has been
already observed, to languages, over which the jurisdiction of
the church of England would be as nugatory as that of any other
denomination of Christians.&nbsp; The manner of conducting these
must be almost, if not entirely, matter of discretion; and such a
committee as the Bible Society has been shown to possess, affords
the best security that such discretion will never be
wanted.&nbsp; So far as the influence of the church in these
cases is of importance, she has it, by the natural constitution
of the committee; and if a preponderating influence be desirable,
the doors are opened for obtaining it by proportional
subscription.&nbsp; Should she adopt this measure, as I trust she
will, &ldquo;you see the consequences as well as I
can.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Society will then contain, beyond all
question, <i>a standing majority in favor of the church</i>; and
there will be no room for apprehending that &ldquo;our present
pure English Bible will be thrust aside to make way for
others:&rdquo; but while &ldquo;every different party has its
doctrine and its interpretation,&rdquo; all parties will have but
<span class="smcap">one Bible</span>. <a
name="citation56b"></a><a href="#footnote56b"
class="citation">[56b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>But, it
seems, you have got possession of a fact which strengthens all
your fears: you have been &ldquo;credibly informed that the
British and Foreign Bible Society are at this time preparing an
edition of the Holy Scriptures in the Welsh language, in which
such liberties are taken in the translation as are by no means
warrantable.&rdquo;&nbsp; You are right in saying you give this
&ldquo;merely as a <i>report</i>;&rdquo; however, I cannot help
suspecting that, where the Bible Society, or any of its
<i>officers</i>, are likely to suffer by it, you have no
particular objection to publishing what are &ldquo;merely
<i>reports</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Others before you have charged upon
the Society the nefarious crime of taking &ldquo;unwarrantable
liberties with the <i>translation</i>&rdquo; and they had just as
good authority for saying so as you have.&nbsp; The fact is, that
<i>the original informer</i> never imputed to the Society the
guilt of altering the <i>translation</i>, but the
<i>orthography</i> of the text; and he, it must be observed, had
never seen any portion of the corrected copy.&nbsp; But before
your pamphlet left the press&mdash;perhaps before it went there;
the parties, to whom the information had been originally
conveyed, were in possession of another sort of
<i>report</i>&mdash;a Report from the Committee of the British
and Foreign Bible Society; in which the corrections that had
occasioned this alarm, were shown to have been made (whether
right or wrong, <i>judicent periti</i>), upon a collation of the
orthographical variations, in the several <i>authorized editions
only</i>.&nbsp; <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>However, the question between the parties is in a train
of arbitration, under the direction of the syndics of the
Cambridge University-press; <i>who</i>, and <i>not the Committee
of the Bible Society</i>, are to be the printers of the Welsh
impression.</p>
<p>But lest the Welsh rumour should subside before the Society is
overthrown, you have another little story to keep up the public
prejudice against it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The author (you say) has
likewise been <i>told</i>, that the distribution of tracts as
well as Bibles, was in the original plan of some of the first
projectors of this scheme, one of whom is known to be a zealous
adversary of the establishment.&rdquo; <a
name="citation58a"></a><a href="#footnote58a"
class="citation">[58a]</a>&nbsp; Now, Sir, it is very possible
that the original projector of this Society, and his project too,
may have been very exceptionable, and yet the present institution
be entitled to a very honorable character.&nbsp; I have never
thought the worse of the Reformation, because I could not for the
life of me think well of Henry the Eighth and his &ldquo;original
plan.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;Philanthropic Society&rdquo; is
founded upon a supposition, which I think a very just one, that
something may be made of the <i>offspring</i>, when nothing can
be made of the <i>parent</i>; <a name="citation58b"></a><a
href="#footnote58b" class="citation">[58b]</a> and I suppose the
Country Clergyman would rather have his pamphlet judged from the
<i>fair copy</i> which he sent to the press, than from any one of
those &ldquo;original plans&rdquo; of it, which were projected by
his busy and <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>inquisitive <i>reporters</i>.&nbsp; The question is,
whether the <i>actual</i> plan of the Society comprehends or
excludes the distribution of <i>tracts</i>.&nbsp; The answer to
this is, that the <i>first article</i> of the constitution
peremptorily <i>excludes</i> them.&nbsp; After such a
declaration, it is as unreasonable to dispute the <i>present</i>
object of the Bible Society, by a reference to any
<i>antecedent</i> designs; as it would be to question whether the
Paradise Lost be an <i>epic poem</i>, merely because it stood as
a <i>drama</i> in Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;original plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I have done.&mdash;My business was not to proclaim the
<i>excellence</i> of the Bible Society; but only to rescue it
from <i>reproach</i>.&nbsp; I have therefore confined my remarks
to those specific objections with which you have opposed it.</p>
<p>What <i>further</i> objections you could have produced (and,
it seems, you have nine times as many in reserve) <a
name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59"
class="citation">[59]</a> I shall not concern myself to inquire:
if they resemble those, which have been already considered, I
rejoice that you have had the grace to conceal them.&nbsp; You
have already condescended enough &ldquo;to do the enemy&rsquo;s
work:&rdquo; and deserved sufficiently well of those who seek the
church&rsquo;s degradation.&nbsp; If this be <i>really</i> the
object of the several denominations of Christians, they are
abundantly more indebted to the hostility of the <i>cassock</i>
than to the friendship of the <i>mitre</i>.&nbsp; <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span><i>Yours</i>,
Sir, is the description of services upon which they will set the
most value: and, if they do you justice, &ldquo;not a single
nonconformist, Papist, Socinian, or Quaker, will be silent in
your praise.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ungrateful wretches would they
be, were they to pass by unnoticed and un-eulogized so great a
friend to their cause.&rdquo; <a name="citation60a"></a><a
href="#footnote60a" class="citation">[60a]</a>&nbsp; But I trust
you have mistaken <i>them</i>, as much as you have dishonored
<i>us</i>: <i>they</i> will hope to get to heaven, though they
should not have pulled down the church in their way; and
<i>we</i> shall hope to get there too, though we should not have
<i>compelled</i> them &ldquo;to be like-minded,&rdquo; nor
refused them the free use of Bibles, and the offices of brotherly
love.</p>
<p>And now, Sir, before I take my leave (a ceremony to which we
are hastening with mutual impatience), let me challenge your
acknowledgment of that courteousness and suavity with which I
have treated you.&nbsp; It was natural for you to expect
revilings and reproaches; you esteem them an &ldquo;honor;&rdquo;
you &ldquo;have enjoyed them before;&rdquo; <a
name="citation60b"></a><a href="#footnote60b"
class="citation">[60b]</a> and I must do you the justice to say,
that you take some pains to deserve them.&nbsp; However, in the
present instance, you have been disappointed.&nbsp; I have
neither reviled nor reproached you: I have not once called you
&ldquo;Beelzebub,&rdquo; through the whole of my letter: I have
never once insinuated that you were a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s
clothing: <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>I have never once pried into the table of your
alliances, nor dodged you from your house to your favorite places
of amusement, nor pretended to know any more of your private
history, than was strictly consistent with &ldquo;a gentleman and
a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I owe this self-government to &ldquo;those
liberal-basis&rsquo;d and broad-bottomed principles,&rdquo; to
which you appear so profound a stranger: and I trust, this
consideration will do a great deal towards recommending them to
your favor.&nbsp; They are, Sir, be assured, the genuine
principles of Christianity, as well as those of the British
constitution.&nbsp; They are calculated to reflect honor on the
church, and to promote harmony through the nation.&nbsp; On them
the British and Foreign Bible Society has been erected; and from
such an institution, resting upon such &ldquo;a basis,&rdquo; the
happiest events may, under God, be expected, to the
country&mdash;to Europe&mdash;and to the habitable world.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
